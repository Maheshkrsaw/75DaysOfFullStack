# Day 19 | Significo Frontend Clone

## Project Overview
This is a **frontend clone of [Significo](https://www.significo.com/)** built as part of my **#75DaysFullStackAI Challenge**.  
Focus: **Tailwind CSS, vanilla JavaScript, animations, responsive layout, and real-world UI replication**.  

- Cloned homepage sections including marquee rows, capsules, team lists, and interactive animations.
- Practiced **JS-based animations**, sticky scrolling, and dynamic layout elements.
- Fully responsive design with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Interactive elements like hover effects, scrolling animations, and marquee components.

## Live Project
- **Frontend** (animations to be added soon): *Will be uploaded shortly*

## Key Learnings
- Breaking down a **complex website layout** into sections is essential for manageable development.
- **Animations & JS interactivity** require patience; building incrementally helps.
- Cloning real websites teaches **frontend structuring and componentization**.
- Frustration is part of learning—**consistency is key to success**.

## Skills Practiced
- **Tailwind CSS**: responsive layout, flex/grid, spacing, typography  
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event handling, animations  
- **Frontend structuring**: breaking down sections, reusable components  
- **Project workflow**: local setup → coding → deployment
