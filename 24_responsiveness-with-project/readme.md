# 🚀 Day 24 – Responsiveness with Media Queries  

Even though I’ve progressed through **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I always felt a lack of confidence when it came to **responsiveness**. Making websites look good on all devices isn’t as easy as it sounds. This day was fully dedicated to improving my understanding of **media queries and responsive layouts**.  

Thanks to a fresh video from **Sheriyans Coding School**, I learned many important concepts, but I still know I need more practice. Responsiveness is something that improves only with **trial, error, and multiple projects**.

- **Flexbox & Grid** adjustments are essential for mobile screens.  
- Testing across devices and Chrome DevTools is a must.  
- Responsiveness isn’t just theory—it requires **real project practice**.
