## 📅 **Day 58 — Headers, Fetch API & Middleware Exploration**

### 🧠 Topics Covered  
1. **HTTP Headers**
   - Headers carry metadata (like content type, authentication tokens, etc.) between client and server.
   - Common headers:  
     - `Content-Type` → defines format (JSON, HTML, etc.)  
     - `Authorization` → used for tokens  
     - `Accept` → what kind of data client expects  
     - `User-Agent`, `Cookie`, etc.  

2. **Fetch API (Browser)**
   - Used to make requests to backend APIs.
   - Practiced GET, POST, and custom header handling.
   - Example:
     ```js
     fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/data', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Mahesh' }),
     })
       .then(res => res.json())
       .then(data => console.log(data));
     ```

3. **Query Params**
   - Sent via URL to pass small bits of data.
   - Example:  
     `GET /users?age=22&city=Patna`
   - Accessed using `req.query` in Express.

4. **Creating Our Own HTTP Server (Again)**
   - Practiced using the `http` module to handle basic routes and responses.
   - Revised request–response model manually to strengthen understanding.

5. **Custom Middleware**
   - Created middleware to log requests and count total hits.
   - Example:
     ```js
     let count = 0;
     const logMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
       count++;
       console.log(`[${req.method}] ${req.url} | Total: ${count}`);
       next();
     };
     app.use(logMiddleware);
     ```

6. **Common Middlewares**
   - `express.json()` or `body-parser.json()` → Parse JSON bodies.
   - `cors()` → Handle cross-origin requests.

### 🧩 Key Learnings  
- Middleware runs between request and response; perfect for logging, authentication, or error handling.  
- Fetch API connects frontend to backend efficiently.  
- Understanding headers and query params helps in debugging network issues.  
- Building your own HTTP server deepens your understanding of Express internals.

### ⚙️ My Situation Today  
Despite Diwali cleaning (5+ hours of housework 😅), I still managed to dedicate 3–4 hours for backend learning.  
Balancing study with real-life tasks feels hard — but progress is still progress!

## 📅 **Day 59 — Deep Dive into CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

### 💡 Concept Overview  
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a browser security feature that allows or restricts resource access between different domains.  
- For example, if the frontend runs on `localhost:3000` and backend on `localhost:5000`, CORS ensures safe communication.  

### 🔍 How It Works  
- Browser sends a **preflight (OPTIONS)** request before the actual API call.  
- Backend must respond with headers like:  
  ```js
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "*"
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE"
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "Content-Type, Authorization"
🧑‍💻 Implementation Steps

Installed and used cors package in Express:

const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());


Tested API access from the frontend using "serve" on port 3000.

Observed how requests succeed or fail based on header settings.

Understood that CORS errors appear due to browser-level protection, not backend bugs.

🧠 Key Learnings

CORS is crucial for secure client–server communication.

The preflight OPTIONS request ensures that backend explicitly permits frontend access.

Debugging CORS issues teaches patience and precision.

I now clearly understand how frontend API calls reach backend safely.

💬 Reflection

Even though Diwali prep made the schedule tight, I still pushed through learning.
Consistency matters more than duration — and every small concept builds the strong backend foundation I’m aiming for.
