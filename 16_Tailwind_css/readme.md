### 💡 Key Tailwind Concepts  
- `m-4`, `p-2` → Margin and padding  
- `text-xl`, `font-bold` → Typography  
- `bg-blue-500`, `text-white` → Colors  
- `flex`, `grid`, `gap-4` → Layout  
- `border`, `rounded-lg` → Borders and radius  
- `shadow-md` → Shadows  
- `md:text-lg`, `lg:p-6` → Responsive breakpoints

## 🧠 Why Tailwind CSS Is a Game-Changer  
**No more switching between HTML and CSS files.**
