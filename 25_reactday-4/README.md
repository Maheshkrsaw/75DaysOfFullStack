# 🚀 75DaysFullStackAI – Day 25

Day 25 of my journey felt challenging yet rewarding. React is slowly opening up, and with each topic, I realize that **grasping fundamentals takes time**. The progress may look slow, but every extra minute I spend now will save hours later.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- **Deeper into React Hooks**
  - Continued practice with `useState` for handling dynamic data
  - Explored array and object manipulation inside state
- **Props (in-depth)**
  - Passing multiple props to child components  
  - Handling props drilling across 2–3 component levels  
  - Realizing where props start becoming hard to manage
- **Event Handling**
  - Writing clean `onClick` functions  
  - Passing event handlers as props to children  
  - Controlling data flow between parent ↔ child
- **Reusable Components**
  - Created multiple components like **Cards** and **Navbar**  
  - Reused them in different scenarios with props variation  
  - Practiced `key` prop usage & avoided warnings

## 🛠️ Mini Projects & Practice
1. **Song Favourites App (Extended)**  
   - Added & removed items from a **favourite list**  
   - Count updated dynamically in Navbar  
   - Gained clarity on **state lifting + props drilling**

2. **Card Component Practice**  
   - Created multiple card variations using a **single component**  
   - Handled button clicks inside cards with event handling

## 💡 Key Learnings
- React’s **component reusability** saves a lot of code  
- Props drilling is a real challenge → excited to explore **Context API** later  
- Event handling is the backbone of React interactivity  
- Debugging state updates teaches patience 😅  

---

## 🎯 Reflection
- ✅ Feeling more confident with React basics  
- ✅ Finally seeing how **state + props + event handling** connect together  
- ⚡ Slow progress, but I’ve accepted that **understanding > rushing**  
- 🔜 Next: Explore **advanced props patterns & starting Context**
