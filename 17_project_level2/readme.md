# 📅 Day 17 – Pinterest Clone + YouTube Music Player 🎵  
Part of my #75DaysFullStackAI challenge 🚀  

---

## 🖼️ Project 1 – Pinterest Look-alike (Search + Cards)  

### ✨ Features  
- Pinterest-style card layout with **TailwindCSS**.  
- **Search functionality**: filters images dynamically as you type.  
- Overlay and input focus/blur effects for smoother UX.  
- Cards generated dynamically from an array of objects.  

### 🔑 Learnings  
- Mastered `input`, `focus`, `blur` event listeners.  
- Learned how to filter arrays with `.startsWith()` for live search.  
- Got hands-on with **dynamic DOM creation** using `innerHTML`.

## 🎵 Project 2 – YouTube Music Mini Player  

### ✨ Features  
- Basic **music player UI** inspired by YT Music/Spotify.  
- Song list dynamically rendered with posters + titles.  
- Controls: **Play, Pause, Forward, Backward**.  
- Poster updates dynamically with the currently playing track.  
- State managed using `isPlaying` flag for clean toggling.  

### 🔑 Learnings  
- Explored **JavaScript Audio API** for the first time.  
- Understood **state management** in UI → play/pause logic.  
- Practiced array handling for songs and images.  
- Realized how core music apps work behind the scenes.

## ⚡ Key Takeaways  
- DOM + Events + Arrays = endless project possibilities 🚀  
- Building real-world clones makes concepts memorable.  
- Debugging gave me confidence in **event-driven programming**.  

---

## 📂 File Structure (Practice Setup)  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Used  
- **HTML5** → base structure  
- **TailwindCSS** → Pinterest UI styling  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** → DOM, Array methods, Audio API  

---

## 🎯 Reflection  
At first, I thought combining **two projects in a single day** would be too much.  
But breaking them into smaller steps (UI → logic → polish) made it manageable.  
Now I feel more confident in building **mini real-world clones** — each project is sharpening my JS skills.  

Consistency is the real key 🔑.
