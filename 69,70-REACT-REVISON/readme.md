# 🧠 Day 69 — React Revision & Reinforcement  

Today’s focus was on revising the **React fundamentals** covered earlier in my **Frontend Domination Course (Sheriyans Coding School)** — concepts that are also part of **Harkirat’s Full Stack course**.  
It was not just a revision, but a strong reinforcement of my React foundation before jumping into advanced topics. ⚛️🔥
