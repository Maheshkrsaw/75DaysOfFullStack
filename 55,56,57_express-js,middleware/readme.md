## 🗓️ **Day 55 — Express.js Basics & Nodemon**

### 📚 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to **Express.js**
- Setting up a simple server
- Understanding **app.get()**, **app.post()**
- Installing and using **Nodemon** for auto-restart

### 💻 Practice:
- Created a simple API returning JSON data.
- Learned how Express simplifies the Node.js server creation process.
- Used Nodemon to avoid restarting the server manually.

### 💡 Key Learnings:

## 🗓️ **Day 56 — Express.js with Postman**

### 📚 Topics Covered:
- Writing routes for **GET** and **POST**
- Testing APIs with **Postman**
- Understanding **request** and **response** flow
- Using Postman’s **Collections**, **Params**, **Headers**, and **Body**

### 💻 Practice:
- Created a mini API and tested endpoints in Postman.
- Explored Postman CLI for automation.
- Sent form data, JSON data, and URL params to server.

### 💡 Key Learnings:
- Postman is a must-have tool for backend testing.
- Every API method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) has a specific purpose.
- API debugging becomes much easier with Postman.

## 🗓️ **Day 57 — Middleware in Express.js**

### 📚 Topics Covered:
- Middleware concept and flow
- Using `app.use()` for global middleware
- Creating custom middleware for routes
- Understanding the **next()** function
- Practicing **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** routes with middleware logic

### 💻 Practice:
- Implemented logging middleware for every request.
- Added middleware for specific route validation.
- Tested how middleware order affects app behavior.

### 💡 Key Learnings:
- Middleware sits **between request and response**, controlling flow.
- Global vs. route-specific middleware difference is key.
- Writing code manually builds true understanding — no copy-paste learning.
- Going slow is fine if you’re learning deeply.
