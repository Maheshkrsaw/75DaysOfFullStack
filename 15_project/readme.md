📋 What I achieved today  
• Integrated Locomotive Scroll for smooth scrolling experience 🌀🖱️  
• Built a custom mouse follower using GSAP for dynamic cursor animation 🧠🖱️  
• Animated hero section elements with GSAP timeline — nav, headings, and footer ✨📜  
• Implemented responsive hover effects on image containers with rotation and movement 🎥🖼️  
• Added interactive scaling logic based on mouse movement velocity 🧪📐  
• Practiced modular animation techniques for layered UI transitions 🎬🧩

📘 Key Concepts Applied  
• Locomotive Scroll — smooth scrolling with inertia and parallax effects 🚂  
• GSAP Timeline — sequencing animations for hero section elements ⏱️  
• Mouse tracking — real-time cursor movement and animation binding 🖱️📍  
• Clamp utility — controlling scale and rotation within safe bounds 🔒📐  
• DOM manipulation — targeting and animating nested image elements 🧠🧱  
• Event listeners — mousemove and mouseleave for dynamic interactivity 🎯  
• Rotation & opacity — enhancing visual feedback on hover 🎨🌀

🧠 Key Takeaways  
• GSAP timelines allow precise control over animation flow and layering 🧠🎞️  
• Mouse-based interactivity boosts user engagement and visual appeal 🖱️💥  
• Combining scroll libraries with animation frameworks creates immersive UX 🌐🎬  
• Clamp functions help maintain smooth and controlled transitions 🔧🧮  
• Modular animation logic improves scalability and reusability 🔁🧩

🗓️ Next Steps  
• Add scroll-triggered animations for section reveals 📜🧲  
• Explore GSAP plugins for advanced effects like morphing and physics 💫🔬  
• Refactor animation logic into reusable components for cleaner code 🧼📦
