# 🚀 Day 30 — 75 Days Full Stack AI Challenge  

## 📅 Date  
**Day 30** of my learning journey.  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered  

### 1. Lifecycle Methods with `useState`  
- Learned how React components update and re-render.  
- Understood the **three cases of `useState` behavior**:  
  - **Update** → state change triggers re-render.  
  - **Re-render** → component re-renders when dependent state updates.  
  - **Particular Component Render (`[]`)** → controlled render cycle using dependency array.  

### 2. Reconciliation in React  
- React uses a virtual DOM and compares it with the real DOM.  
- Only updates what has changed → efficient performance.  

### 3. Conditional Rendering (Recall)  
- Practiced again with **loading states** and conditional logic (`if`, ternary, && operator).  
- Reinforced why conditional rendering is important for user experience.  

### 4. Context API  
- **Overview**: A way to avoid prop drilling and manage global state.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Created a `context` folder.  
  - Used `createContext`, `Provider`, and `useContext`.  
  - Passed data globally to multiple components.  

### 5. Dynamic URL (Recall)  
- Revised parameter-based routing (`useParams`).  
- Revisited how dynamic URLs allow passing data between pages.  

---

## 🛠️ Practical Exercises  
- Implemented a **context provider** in a separate folder.  
- Tested `useState` rendering cases with small projects.  
- Recreated conditional rendering for loaders.  
- Built routing examples with dynamic URLs.  

---

## 🎯 Reflection  
- Yesterday felt incomplete, but today I **revised + practiced properly**.  
- Now the concepts of `useState`, reconciliation, and Context API are much clearer.  
- Key takeaway → **Consistency and repetition bring clarity**.  

---

## 🌐 Resources Used  
- Sheriyans React tutorials.  
- React official docs (for `useState` and Context API).

# 🚀 Days 23–30 — 75 Days Full Stack AI Challenge  

This README documents my learnings from **Day 23 to Day 30** of my 75 Days Full Stack AI journey.  

---

## 📅 Day 23 — React `useState` Deep Dive  
- `useState` basics in depth.  
- Practiced with arrays and objects.  
- Advanced array updates (4 practice questions).  
- Learned proper immutable state updates.  

---

## 📅 Day 24 — CSS Media Queries & Responsiveness  
- Practiced media queries for multiple devices.  
- Built first project focused on responsiveness.  
- Learned how layouts adapt on different screen sizes.  
- Still need more practice on responsive design.  
- 🌐 [Live Project](https://maheshkrsaw.github.io/75DaysOfFullStack/24_responsiveness-with-project/)  

---

## 📅 Day 25 — React Hooks & Props  
- Learned `useState` basics.  
- Props definition, usage, and importance.  
- Props drilling across components.  
- Event handling in React.  
- Built card & navbar components with add/remove favorites feature.  

---

## 📅 Day 26 — Form Handling + React One-Shot Revision  
- Controlled components in React forms.  
- Practiced with `useRef` and `react-hook-form`.  
- Watched Sheriyans **React One-Shot** video → revision of:  
  - React Intro & setup with Vite.  
  - JSX, Virtual DOM, folder structure.  
  - useState, CSS handling, functions in React.  
  - Form handling, two-way binding, props drilling.  
  - Rendering JSON, Axios API integration.  
  - React Router DOM, Toastify.  
  - useEffect, useRef, Context API, Redux Toolkit.  
  - Framer Motion, Deployment.  

---

## 📅 Day 27 — Form Handling Practice  
- Practiced form handling with `useRef`.  
- Built cards & forms as components.  
- Passed data via props from parent to child components.  
- Added/removable data directly via UI.  

---

## 📅 Day 28 — React Router DOM  
- Routes and Route basics.  
- React Router DOM properties.  
- `Link` and `NavLink` usage (className & span).  
- Dynamic routing with `useParams`.  
- Navigation using `useNavigate`.  
- Nested routing with `Outlet`.  
- 🌐 [Live Project](https://75-days-of-full-stack-rvch.vercel.app/)  

---

## 📅 Day 29 — API Handling in React  
- Practiced API calls: `fetch`, `ajax`, `axios`.  
- Learned GET & POST request handling.  
- Faced difficulties staying consistent in study hours.  

---

## 📅 Day 30 — Lifecycle & Context API  
- Lifecycle methods implementation with `useState`.  
- Three types of `useState`: update, rerender, specific component render.  
- Reconciliation (Virtual DOM updates).  
- Conditional rendering recall (loading states).  
- Context API: `createContext`, `Provider`, `useContext`.  
- Implemented Context API in a separate folder.  
- Revised dynamic routing with `useParams`.  

---

## 🎯 Final Reflection  
From **Day 23 to Day 30**, I went through major **React fundamentals** (useState, props, form handling, routing, API calls, lifecycle methods, and Context API) while also practicing **responsiveness with CSS**.  

- Faced challenges with consistency (study hours dropped some days).  
- React concepts took longer to grasp, but repetition improved clarity.  
- Realized the importance of **patience, consistency, and practice**.  
- Projects and live links helped in solidifying concepts practically.
