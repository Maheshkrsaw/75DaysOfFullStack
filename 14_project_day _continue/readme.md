# 🚀 Day 14 – JavaScript Functions & Scope

Today marks **Day 14 of my #75DaysFullStackAI challenge**.  
The focus was on **JavaScript Functions, Parameters, Return values, and Scope (local vs global)**.  

At first, the concepts of **return values and scope** were tricky, but breaking them into **small practice snippets** really helped.  
Writing real examples gave me more confidence in how data flows inside functions.

## 📚 What I Practiced Today
- Different ways to declare functions (`function`, `arrow functions`, `function expressions`)  
- **Parameters & Arguments** → Passing data inside functions  
- **Return Statement** → Sending values back  
- **Scope** → Local, Global, Block  
- Wrote **mini utility functions** to reinforce the concepts  

---

## ⚡ Key Takeaways
- A function helps **reuse code** instead of repeating logic  
- **Return values** send results back to the caller  
- Scope defines **where variables are accessible**  
- Using **const/let vs var** changes how scope behaves  
- Start small → build confidence → move to larger projects

## 📂 File Structure (Practice Setup)

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Used
- **HTML5** → For running test cases in browser  
- **CSS3** → Minimal styling for outputs  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** → Practicing functions & scope  

---

## 🎯 Reflection
In the beginning, I got confused with **how return works**.  
For example, I thought return sends the value "back to the function", but actually it sends it to **where the function was called**.  

The difference between **local and global scope** also felt tricky, but experimenting with examples made it clear.  
Now I can **confidently create utility functions** and know how data is passed & returned.
