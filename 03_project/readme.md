## 📋 What I achieved today
- Built a product showcase web page with navigation and call-to-action buttons  
- Practiced layout with flexbox for header, center content, and right-side elements  
- Added interactive hover effects on product options  
- Used background images with `background-size` and `background-position` for a visually appealing section  
- Styled buttons and links with hover effects  
- Pushed all practice files & notes to GitHub

## 📘 Topics & Concepts Covered
- **Flexbox Layout** — for header, center, and right sections  
- **CSS Hover Effects** — opacity and color changes on interactive elements  
- **Typography & Text Styling** — line-height, font-size, font-weight, and text-align  
- **Background Images** — `background-size: cover`, `background-position`  
- **Box Model & Padding** — spacing for divs and elements  
- **Pseudo-classes** — hover states on links and icons

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Flexbox is very effective for aligning multi-section layouts  
- Hover effects improve user experience and interactivity  
- Background images can enhance the design when positioned and sized correctly  
- Clean structure and semantic HTML make the page maintainable

## 🗓️ Next Steps
- Make the layout responsive for different screen sizes  
- Add more product cards dynamically with HTML & CSS  
- Explore transitions and animations for smoother hover effects
