## 📅 **Day 67 — Backend Progress (Course Selling Website)**

### 🧠 **What I Worked On**
- Continued implementing the **Course Selling Website backend**.  
- Completed all **User Endpoints**:  
  - Signup  
  - Login  
  - Purchase Course  
  - View Purchased Courses  
- Implemented **Admin Endpoints**:  
  - Signup/Login  
  - Create Course  
  - Get All Courses  
  - Bulk operations using Express routes.  
- Used **Middleware** for authentication (admin/user).  
- Used **dotenv** for environment variables and MongoDB connection string.  
- Solved **circular import issues** by creating a central route file.  

### ⚙️ **Tech Used**
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB (Atlas)  
- Mongoose  
- JWT (jsonwebtoken)  
- dotenv  

### 💭 **Reflection**
> Due to festival work (Chhath Puja 🎆), I couldn’t focus fully but still pushed myself to code.  
Even partial progress counts — consistency matters more than perfection.

## 📅 **Day 68 — MongoDB & Backend Recap**

### 🎯 **Focus Areas**
- Quick recap of **MongoDB basics**:  
  - Schema creation  
  - Export/import models across files  
  - CRUD operations  
  - Connecting MongoDB Atlas with `.env`  
- Revisited **Course Selling Website** backend:
  - Admin Routes  
  - User Routes  
  - JWT Authorization  
  - Mongoose integration  

### 📚 **Core Concepts Revised**
- `mongoose.Schema()` — define structure  
- `module.exports` — export models  
- `require('./modelname')` — use schema in other files  
- `.env` for secure DB credentials  
- `try-catch` for async/await error handling  

### 🧠 **Key Learnings**
- Schema planning saves debugging time.  
- JWT authorization logic must be modular.  
- Data flow from frontend → backend → DB is clear now.
