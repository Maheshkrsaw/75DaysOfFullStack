# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# ⚛️ Day 21 — React Basics

Today I officially stepped into the **React world**.  
Learning React was exciting, and I hope to continue with the same motivation as I move forward in my **#75DaysFullStackAI Challenge**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered Before Diving Into React
To build a strong foundation, I revised important JavaScript concepts:
- **Mutable vs Immutable Data**
- **Reference vs Primitive Types**
- **useState Hook (basic intro)**
- **Spread Operator (`...`)**
- **Destructuring (Arrays & Objects)**
- **Import & Export (overview only)**
- **Arrow Functions**
- **Implicit Return in Functions**
- **Array Methods: `.map()` and `.filter()`**

---

## ⚛️ React Basics Learned
1. **React History & Evolution**  
   - Why React is popular  
   - Role of the **Virtual DOM**

2. **Installation & Setup**  
   - Node.js installed  
   - `npm create vite@latest` for React project  
   - Commands: `npm install`, `npm run dev`  

3. **Project File Structure**  
   - `main.jsx` → Entry point  
   - `App.jsx` → Main component  
   - Connection between files (`ReactDOM.createRoot` & `<App />`)  

4. **JSX (JavaScript + XML)**  
   - Embedding HTML-like syntax inside JS  
   - Dynamic rendering with `{}`  

5. **Components**  
   - What are components and why we use them  
   - Created **2–3 functional components**  
   - Linked them inside `App.jsx`

## 🛠️ Example Structure

## 💡 Key Learnings
- React makes UI building **modular & reusable**  
- **Virtual DOM** improves performance  
- **Components** are like building blocks of an app  
- Initial setup may feel tricky, but once connected, everything flows smoothly

## 🎯 Reflection
Learning React basics gave me confidence.  
The journey ahead may be challenging, but with consistency and curiosity, I believe I’ll enjoy every step.
