# 🚀 Day 30 — 75 Days Full Stack AI Challenge  

## 📅 Date  
**Day 30** of my learning journey.

## 📚 Topics Covered  

### 1. Lifecycle Methods with `useState`  
- Learned how React components update and re-render.  
- Understood the **three cases of `useState` behavior**:  
  - **Update** → state change triggers re-render.  
  - **Re-render** → component re-renders when dependent state updates.  
  - **Particular Component Render (`[]`)** → controlled render cycle using dependency array.  

### 2. Reconciliation in React  
- React uses a virtual DOM and compares it with the real DOM.  
- Only updates what has changed → efficient performance.  

### 3. Conditional Rendering (Recall)  
- Practiced again with **loading states** and conditional logic (`if`, ternary, && operator).  
- Reinforced why conditional rendering is important for user experience.  

### 4. Context API  
- **Overview**: A way to avoid prop drilling and manage global state.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Created a `context` folder.  
  - Used `createContext`, `Provider`, and `useContext`.  
  - Passed data globally to multiple components.  

### 5. Dynamic URL (Recall)  
- Revised parameter-based routing (`useParams`).  
- Revisited how dynamic URLs allow passing data between pages.  

---

## 🛠️ Practical Exercises  
- Implemented a **context provider** in a separate folder.  
- Tested `useState` rendering cases with small projects.  
- Recreated conditional rendering for loaders.  
- Built routing examples with dynamic URLs.  

---

## 🎯 Reflection  
- Yesterday felt incomplete, but today I **revised + practiced properly**.  
- Now the concepts of `useState`, reconciliation, and Context API are much clearer.  
- Key takeaway → **Consistency and repetition bring clarity**.

## 🌐 Resources Used  
- Sheriyans React tutorials.  
- React official docs (for `useState` and Context API).
