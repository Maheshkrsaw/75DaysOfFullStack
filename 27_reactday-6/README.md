# ðŸš€ Day 27 â€“ React: Form Handling & Props with useRef | #75DaysFullStackAI

Today, I focused on practicing **form handling** in React and building a structured component flow with live DOM manipulation using `useRef`. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the learning, projects, challenges, and reflection.

---

##  Practice Projects

1. **Card + Form Components**
   - Created `Card` and `Form` as separate components.
   - Used `useRef` in the form component for DOM access (e.g., retrieving input values via `.current.value`).

2. **Data Flow via Props**
   - Managed form data submission from `App.jsx`.
   - Passed data as props from the main container to child components, maintaining a clear data flow from parent â†’ child.

3. **Live Add / Remove Functionality**
   - Enabled adding and removing data directly via browser interactions.
   - Component updates with `useRef` handled seamlessly, similar to the video example followed.

##  Key Learnings
- **Modular Components**: Separating UI logic into `Card` and `Form` improves reusability and clarity.
- **Props-based Data Flow**: Passing data through props keeps parent and child components decoupled yet connected.
- **useRef Usage**: Provides direct access to DOM elements for fast input value retrieval without re-rendering.
- **Live Updates**: Front-end state updates happen in real-time based on user interactionâ€”crucial for dynamic form behavior.

##  Reflective Note (Honest Self-Check)
To be honestâ€”Iâ€™m not satisfied with myself. In recent days, my study time has significantly dropped. Power cuts and distractions mean sometimes I only manage *one topic per day*. But reflecting now: *that isnâ€™t enough for the future Iâ€™m building*. 

Yet I won't let it stop me. I may be behind today's target, but I will continue with consistency. I *will* be better tomorrow than I was today.
