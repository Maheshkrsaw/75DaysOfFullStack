# 🌐 Significo Clone (Frontend)

This project is part of my **#75DaysFullStackAI Challenge (Day 20)** where I cloned the [Significo](https://www.significo.com/) website frontend.  
The goal was to replicate the UI, animations, and responsive design to sharpen my frontend development skills.

## 💡 Key Learnings
1. Cloning real websites builds practical UI/UX skills  
2. Tailwind CSS feels challenging initially, but speeds up workflow once mastered  
3. Breaking complex sections into smaller parts makes development smoother  
4. Animations test patience but improve problem-solving ability  
5. Consistency and persistence matter more than perfection

## 🎯 Reflections
- Faced multiple moments of frustration and almost gave up, but consistency kept me going  
- Learned to combine mentorship + AI tools to overcome blockers
